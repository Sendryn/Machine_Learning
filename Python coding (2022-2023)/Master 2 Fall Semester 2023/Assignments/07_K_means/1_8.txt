According to the results from section 1.7, what is the best value of k according to the objective function?
The best value of k are the lowest value according to the objective function.

If we have n samples and we set k=n, what would happen ?
Each sample would be treated as its own cluster.

Is it a good strategy to set k=n? Why/Why not?
Not a good strategy because each sample is treated as a seperate cluster and this is not what we want in clustering.
