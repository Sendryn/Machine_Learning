Section 1.4

Judging from all these plots, which dimensions do you think correlate best with the first dimension?
The best plot that are correlating best with the first dimension are : 1st plot, 3rd plot, 4th plot, 21st plot, 23rd plot and 24th plot.


Using the information about the dataset, what are the names of those features?
Those features are : radius_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, radius_worst, perimeter_worst, area_worst.


Can you explain why it makes sense that these are the dimensions that best correlate with the first one as opposed to the other dimensions?
These plots are the best correlated one with the first dimension because of the linear curve pattern that we can see in each of these plots.
