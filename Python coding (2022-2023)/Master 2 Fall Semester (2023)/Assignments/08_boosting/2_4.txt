Upload the Gradient boosting classifier accuracy, precision and recall on the test set. How does it compare to the random forest classifier?

RandomForestClassifier
accuracy = 0.8208955223880597
precision = 0.7956989247311828
recall = 0.7184466019417476

GradiantBoostingClassifier
accuracy = 0.8246268656716418
precision = 0.8111111111111111
recall = 0.7087378640776699

Accuracy: The Gradient Boosting Classifier has a slightly higher accuracy (0.8246) compared to the Random Forest Classifier (0.8209).

Precision: The Gradient Boosting Classifier also has a higher precision (0.8111) compared to the Random Forest Classifier (0.7957). This indicates that, among the instances predicted as positive, a higher proportion are true positives for the Gradient Boosting model.

Recall: The Random Forest Classifier has a higher recall (0.7184) compared to the Gradient Boosting Classifier (0.7087). This means that the Random Forest Classifier is better at capturing a higher proportion of actual positive instances.

In conclusion, the Gradient Boosting Classifier performs slightly better in terms of accuracy and precision, except for recall where both classifier is similar.
